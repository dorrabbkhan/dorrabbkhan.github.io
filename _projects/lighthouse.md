description: App to aid in finding missing people, built for Google's Solutions Challenge 2022 using Firebase & Flutter
---

I was the founder and software architect for a non-profit app that helps document and locate missing people. I worked on cloud architecture, project management, backend design, monitoring, CI/CD, branding and marketing. The app won the Europe-wide Google DSC-EU Ideathon 2022, and later finished in top 50 worldwide for the Google DSC Solution Challenge 2022.
Technologies used: Dart, Flutter, Firebase, NodeJS, Google Maps API

Watch the quick video below to learn more about the idea behind the app:

Unfortunately, the development of the app was discontinued due to differing visions and motivations of the founding team.
