title: Smart Glove (Bachelors Thesis)
description: Smart glove that works with multiple IMUs, performs sensor fusion and uses the random forests machine learning algorithm to detect hand gestures
---

For my bachelor's thesis, I designed a smart glove that works with multiple IMUs, performs sensor fusion and uses the random forests machine learning algorithm to detect hand gestures. Results obtained had a high accuracy of upto 97.2%.
Technologies used: Python, Raspberry Pi, IMU sensors, Scikit-learn, Jupyter, Pandas, Seaborn
